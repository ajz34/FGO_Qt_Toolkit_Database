Figures in this repository (`servant_icon`, `servant_icon_final`, `servant_icon_present`) have been transformed by ImageMagick for warning ICCP from libpng. These figures are collected from http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/, and are licensed to CC BY-SA 3.0.

Figures in this repository (`event_figure`) are downloaded from https://www.fate-go.jp/; however, these figures have been shown on http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/. For display beauty, I used ImageMagick 7.0.8 to replace alpha channel to white background.

Data of `item/event_item.*` are collected from two sources:
* for Exp, QP, piece, gems, monuments, as well as event period, are collected from http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/ (I just collected the data in points reward and event shop, not all information such as completion reward and notable drops)
* for the more important gold, silver, bronze item, as well as crystal lore, holy grail, they are collected from excellent arrangement by LYC869 (https://bbs.ngacn.cc/read.php?tid=11081996)
